  <div class="aboutme"

  <p> <strong> Background </strong></p>
  
  <p> I am a Kenyan female, a farmer by profession. I run a poultry farm alongside some small subsistence
    farming. I love farming. Its productive, engaging and very calming. I keep chicken for their
    meat and eggs. Its not always as romantic and rosy as it sounds. However, despite its challenges,
    farming has its rewarding moments.

  <p>Reason for programming</p>

  <p> I decided to take a programming class so as to diversify my set of skills. I have worked with SQL
    databases, Python, SAP and excel for donkey years. I am looking for a new experience. A change is as good 
    as a rest.</p>
 
  <p>Hobbies and interests</p>
    
  <p>When I am not farming or mining data , I read. I read alot. I enjoy reading biographies as well as books 
    based on Historical events. I enjoy spending time with my family, watch movies and going for long walks.</p>

  <p> This is the list of projects that I have worked on
    <ol>
    <li>My first website  <a href="my-first-webpage.html">  wildcats </a>.</p></li>  
    <li> This I like to do  <a href="my-favourite-things.html">  My favourite things </a>.</p></li>  </li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p> The projects have been built using html and css. They are projects I did in my class work.</p>
